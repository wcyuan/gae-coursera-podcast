Start the dev server with:

  dev_appserver.py <path to directory>

then point a browser at:

  http://localhost:8080/

More info at https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/devserver

The server listens for changes to files and reloads them as necessary,
so no need to restart the server for most code changes.

Register a new app at:

  http://<your_app_id>.appspot.com/
